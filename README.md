#Game rules

You may start of your move with either a sjadam jump or a legal chess move.
Once you do a chess move (or rightclick on a tile), your turn ends.
The sjadam jump is valid if you can jump over a piece onto an empty field. It can be any direction; north/south, west/east or sideways.
You may jump over as many of your own pieces as you like, but only over one opponent piece each turn.
You may do a chess move whenever you feel like it.
If any piece except the king makes it all the way to the opponents side, it evolves into a queen.
